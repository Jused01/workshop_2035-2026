# Frontend-Backend Integration Guide

## Overview
The frontend and backend have been successfully integrated. Here's what has been implemented:

## Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/games` - Create a new game
- `POST /api/games/join` - Join an existing game with a code
- `POST /api/games/start` - Start a game (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/games/<gameId>` - Get game state
- `POST /api/validate/<slug>` - Validate puzzle solutions

## SocketIO Events
- `room:join` - Join a game room
- `chat:msg` - Send chat messages
- `puzzle:state` - Sync puzzle state between clients
- `puzzle:result` - Broadcast puzzle completion results

## Frontend Changes Made

### 1. API Service (`src/services/api.js`)
- Replaced Firebase service with backend API calls
- Added authentication token handling
- Implemented all game management functions

### 2. Socket Service (`src/services/Socket.js`)
- Implemented real SocketIO connection
- Added event handlers for all backend events
- Proper authentication and room management

### 3. App Component (`src/App.JSX`)
- Updated to use backend API for game creation/joining
- Added loading and error states
- Proper token management

### 4. Game Components
- Updated GameRoom to use real SocketIO connection
- Added backend validation to Enigme1Puzzle
- Enhanced error handling throughout

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend (.env)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Backend (.env)
```
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

## How to Run

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd manoir-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features Working
- ✅ Game creation and joining
- ✅ Real-time chat via SocketIO
- ✅ Puzzle validation through backend
- ✅ Authentication with JWT tokens
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Multiplayer room management

## Next Steps
1. Test the full integration by running both servers
2. Add more puzzle validations to other enigmes
3. Implement player list synchronization
4. Add game state persistence
5. Enhance error handling and user feedback
